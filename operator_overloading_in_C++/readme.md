# Operator Overloading

In c++ we overload operators to do operations on user defined class aka class and their objects.

like we can add two integers in c++ using + now we need to find some tachnique by using it we can add two user defined data types like structures and objects

```
int a;
float b,sum;
sum=a+b;
```
